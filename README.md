# spark-sklearn-airbnb-predict
Code example to predict prices of Airbnb vacation rentals, using scikit-learn on Spark.

The [Jupyter notebook in this repo](https://github.com/mapr-demos/spark-sklearn-airbnb-predict/blob/master/python_scikit_airbnb.ipynb) contains examples to run regression estimators on the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) listings dataset from San Francisco.  The target variable that needs to be predicted is the price of the listing.  To speed up the hyperparameter search, the notebook shows examples that use the spark-sklearn package to distribute GridSearchCV across nodes in a Spark cluster.  This provides a much faster way to search and can lead to better results.

To run the scikit-learn examples (without Spark) the following packages are required:
* Python 2
* Pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn (0.17 or later)

These can be installed on the [MapR Sandbox](https://www.mapr.com/products/mapr-sandbox-hadoop).

To run the scikit-learn examples with Spark, the following packages are required on each machine:
* All of the above packages
* Spark (1.5 or later)
* [spark-sklearn](https://github.com/databricks/spark-sklearn) -- follow the installation instructions there

You can run this on a MapR cluster by following one of these methods:
* Use the [MapR Sandbox](https://www.mapr.com/products/mapr-sandbox-hadoop), which comes with Spark pre-installed.  You must install Pandas, NumPy and scikit-learn.
* If you have multiple machines available, use the [MapR Community Edition](https://www.mapr.com/products/hadoop-download) and install the mapr-spark package on each machine, following the [Spark on YARN documentation](http://maprdocs.mapr.com/51/#Spark/SparkonYARN.html)

Run the script with:

```MASTER=yarn-client /opt/mapr/spark/spark-1.5.2/bin/spark-submit --num-executors=4 --executor-cores=8 python_scikit_airbnb.py```

(setting num-executors and executor-cores to suit your environment)

The file ```classify.py``` in this repo contains an example of classification on the same dataset, using ```reviews.csv``` and text analysis.

and of course... have fun!
